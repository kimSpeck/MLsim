# compare PVI and ENET predictors
# is PVI > 1 equivalent to predictor selection based on regularization?

# can we somehow check this for GBMs as well?

# 1. read in PVI data and ENET model data
# 2. compare if variables are extracted or not?
# confusion matrix: extracted in ENET {yes, no} vs. PVI > 1 {yes, no}
